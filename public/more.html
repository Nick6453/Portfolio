<p>I started studying at groves high school and after three years being there i moved to another school call jankins high school and its okay by the followign reasons:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The school is bigger than groves school</li>
    <li>jenkins high school is close to where i live</li>
    <li>and i guess it has better teachers</li>
</ol>
<p>but also being at groves high school was really  helpful to me because I went there withut knowing any english at all and there is a program called ESOL so i took that program for about 3 years and I have learned a lot of english</p>
<ul>
    <li>teachers really care about the students</li>
    <li>there were more opportunities to join big clubs in groves high school</li>
    <li>they are very friendly</li>
</ul>
